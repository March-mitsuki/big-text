# Big Text
An app that achieves **true fullscreen** scrolling display of information on web pages.

# Motivation
It's 2025 and I still need to install an app just to display scrolling text? That seems a bit... excessive, don't you think?

And so, this project was born.

# Core Implementation
By rendering a hidden canvas on the page and capturing frames as video element content, we circumvent the limitation that web pages can't go fullscreen.

Since the end user is ultimately viewing a fullscreen video, and every browser has definitely optimized video playback to support fullscreen functionality.

# Bug Report
Just file an issue, or if you're interested, feel free to submit a PR.

# Feature Request
Same thing—just file an issue, or you can write it yourself and submit a PR. As long as it's not adding unnecessary complexity and passes testing, it'll generally be accepted.
